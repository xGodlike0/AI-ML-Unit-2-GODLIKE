The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a given value. We can use this information to generate random samples from the distribution.\n",

The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a given value.

To do this, we take the inverse of the CDF, which gives us a function that maps probabilities to corresponding values of X. We then apply this inverse function to U to get a value of X that corresponds to the probability U.\n",

    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 as many times as necessary to generate the desired number of random samples. Each time step 4 is performed, we generate a new value of X that corresponds to a different probability U. By repeating this process many times, we can generate a large number of random samples from the desired probability distribution."
